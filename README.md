# Comic Book API

This API provides endpoints to manage a comic book collection, allowing users to create, update, delete, and fetch comic books with advanced filtering, pagination, and sorting options.

## Features
- Create, update, delete, and retrieve comic books
- Advanced filtering, pagination, and sorting for comic listings
- Centralized error handling
- Environment variable configuration

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance (local or remote)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/comic-book-api.git
   cd comic-book-api
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
     ```
     PORT=3000
     CONN_STR=mongodb://your_mongodb_connection_string
     ```

4. **Run the API:**
   ```bash
